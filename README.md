This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

###assignment 2
```
contract: GuessNumber.sol

npx hardhat test GuessNumber.js
```


###assignment 3
```
